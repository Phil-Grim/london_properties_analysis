       "  'Description': 'Have my mum as your neighbour! There are many great reasons to come and live in this stunning garden maisonette on Eton Avenue, but the fact that my mum lives three doors away has to be the top one. There’s no doubt that I am biased. In reality, many of you will love the fact it was refurbished only two years ago and has 3.5m ceiling heights in the reception, or prefer the vast 77’ south facing sun-soaked garden with sauna, or place a higher value on having a magnificent eat-in kitchen with a table that sits next to some of the most beautiful windows I have ever seen overlooking those gardens. You may favour the excellent connectivity from the kitchen to the garden, with an external staircase straight down to the large paved seating area with electric heaters leading onto a lovely lawn, more than having my mum as your neighbour. Some deluded people will think that having a three double bedroom apartment (all en-suite), with the master bedroom opening directly onto the garden, is better than having her close by, but that’s because you haven’t met her yet.Great things about the area include having Trevor Roberts, The Hall, Hereward House (my old school) and Sarum Hall, all within walking distance of 300 meters. Belsize Village and England’s Lane are just a short walk away, with their friendly vibes and community. Primrose Hill is 0.7 miles away, and Hampstead Heath is nearby. With Swiss Cottage (Jubilee) Underground 0.2 miles away and Belsize Park 0.7 miles (Northern Line), you can easily be in Mayfair or Canary Wharf. BUT of course, the best thing about this area is (you guessed it) having my mum 30m away!EPC Rating: E'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'A rare chance for either investors interested in a huge rental return, or a growing family wishing their children to have their own bedrooms upstairs. This 4 bedroom terrace house\\xa0is in the very upcoming suburb of New Southgate, which is soon to be transformed into a major transport hub.New Southgate Rail Station is 15-20 min walk or 5 mins on the hopper bus that comes to end of the street, and the same distance/Bus ride applies to Arnos Grove Tube Station (Piccadilly Line). Free on street parking and very easy access to the A406 (and outside of the ULEZ zone) and large open parks. There are many highly rated schools nearby, including the 5 star excellent rated St. Andrews, which lies a mere 5 minute walk from the property.The property is a Freehold, Victorian, original brick fronted house, whose lounge looks out onto a lovely white elm tree. The lounge features an original brick build fireplace and the room itself is flooded with natural light.\\xa0The kitchen is separate (no cooking smells in the lounge!) and newly finished to a contemporary design with oak panelling with expensive chrome handles. It will be sold furnished with a fridge, washing machine, oven, hob and extractor fan. It is a large space and great for any budding chefs or those who spend lots of time in the kitchen. There is room for a small dining table. The boiler is modern and has been regularly serviced by Valiant (the top boiler brand in the market) professionals.The WC and shower room is downstairs in the property, to the rear of the kitchen (in the original Victorian era design). It is newly tiled in Metro white with black grout and again has lots of space for family wash time, which can be taxing, as all parents of young children will understand!Upstairs there are 4 rooms, a it is a space that is extremely rare and hard to find in this area. The fourth bedroom is small but would suit being an office space or a bedroom for a younger child. It features lots of natural light. There is no upstairs bathroom, but for a large family it means that the parents can be upstairs at night with their 3 children. A bathroom could easily and cheaply be fitted in the rear bedroom, however, as the pipework links to the downstairs bathroom. This space is also ideal for landlords, who will benefit financially from the 4th small study/bedroom, over the years. All doors in the property are fire rated and fitted with anti smoke strips. There are mains linked smoke alarms in every room. The garden is spacious and comes with a shed for storage and a maintenance free grass area.Newly redecorated in traditional white with new high Victorian style skirting and archetrave, this quirky but spacious house will sell quickly, so please get in touch now to arrange a viewing. The property is vacant and chain free, and on that basis a swifter conveyance than normal is expected (no chain buyers please, unless you are close to completion on your existing property).\\rTenure: Freehold\\rCouncil Tax: D'},\n",
